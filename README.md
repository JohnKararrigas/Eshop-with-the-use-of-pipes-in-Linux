# Eshop-with-the-use-of-pipes-in-Linux

In main function we have a list of all the products the eshop has with some extra information about the price and the quantity. This project has to do with parent and child processes and we continue with the customer finishing his order.

At the end we provide information for each product and the profits that the shop has from it.
